The UNESCO publication [*Community Radio - A user's guide to the technology*](static/CommunityRadioUserGuide.pdf) features a very comprehensive guide to setting up a community radio station. This guide is aimed at people thinking about setting up a radio station in India, but includes lots of practical advice that would be useful in any country.
