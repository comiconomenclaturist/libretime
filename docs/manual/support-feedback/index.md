If you did not already register Airtime when you installed it, as shown in the *Getting Started* chapter, you can click **Support Feedback** on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">System</span> menu to display Airtime's automated feedback options. Check the **Send support feedback** box in order to post technical details about your Airtime installation to Sourcefabric, over the Internet. These details help Sourcefabric diagnose any problem that you might be having with your Airtime system.

You may also wish to send details of your station to Sourcefabric, so that your station has the opportunity to be promoted with other Airtime users on the [http://www.sourcefabric.org](http://www.sourcefabric.org/) website. This feature also helps Sourcefabric target its support services to the countries where they are needed most. Check the box **Promote my station on Sourcefabric.org** and fill in the details of your station. You can upload a station logo file (of up to 600 x 600 pixels) from your desktop computer by clicking the **Browse** button.
