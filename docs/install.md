Installing LibreTime
====================

LibreTime should generally be installed on a dedicated host. By default, its installer will install and configure all its dependencies. At the moment, the installer works best on Ubuntu Trusty.

    :::bash
    ./install

Plans are in the works for ```.deb``` and ```.rpm``` packages, as well as Docker and AWS images.
